<strong class = "main-strong" > Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the
run! </strong>
The three meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat
Boggis, squat Bunce,
and skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and
his family surrounded.
What they don't know is that they're not dealing with just
any fox â€“ Mr. Fox
would never surrender. But only the most fantastic plan ever
can save him now.
